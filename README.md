# ✈️ Airline Performance Analysis

This project explores the financial and operational performance of airlines across global regions, using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization. The analysis focuses on comparing low-cost and non-low-cost carriers, as well as a comparative analysis to determine the region with the most efficient and profitable airlines.

## 🎯 Project Focus

- Compare performance metrics between low-cost and non-low-cost carriers  
- Analyze airline efficiency and profitability across different regions  
- Visualize key insights using Tableau

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Non-low-cost carriers** generated higher average EBIT ($981M) than **low-cost carriers** ($284M).  
- **Low-cost carriers** typically operate **newer fleets**, averaging 7.3 years compared to 11.4 years for non-low-cost airlines.  
- **Passenger yield** (revenue per km) was higher among non-low-cost carriers — $0.10/km vs $0.06/km.  
- The **Middle East** outperformed other regions in revenue and aircraft utilization, with an average EBIT of $1.9B and efficient use of fleet resources.  
- **Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America** had the highest number of low-cost carriers, while **Africa had none** in the dataset.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQL (PostgreSQL)  
- Tableau
